## 2026-04-01 — Phase 18: Contact Data Model Upgrade

- **Branch**: `feature/phase18-data-model-upgrade` → **PR #23**
- **What was built**: Migration adds 7 new real columns to `contacts` (`title`, `city`, `country`, `linkedin_url`, `seniority`, `email_status`, `email_verified_at`) and 7 to `companies` (`country`, `city`, `linkedin_url`, `tech_stack`, `revenue_range`, `founded_year`, `description`); partial unique index on `companies(workspace_id, domain)`; backfill from `custom_fields` (additive); `database.types.ts` updated for both tables; `add-contacts` route writes to real columns instead of `custom_fields` and now passes `email_status`; Prospector page passes `linkedin_url`; contacts list has new Title column; contact detail shows email_status badge + read-only Title/Location/LinkedIn fields
- **Files changed**: 7 — `supabase/migrations/20260401150000_phase18_data_model_upgrade.sql` (new), `src/lib/database.types.ts`, `src/app/api/prospector/add-contacts/route.ts`, `src/app/(dashboard)/prospector/page.tsx`, `src/components/contacts/contacts-page-client.tsx`, `src/components/contacts/contact-detail-client.tsx`, `src/components/lists/filter-builder.tsx`
- **Migration**: Applied to `wdgiwuhehqpkhpvdzzzl` via Supabase MCP
- **Build status**: TypeScript clean (`tsc --noEmit` zero errors); lint zero warnings; pre-existing prerender env-var build failure on `/login` (unrelated, same as previous phases)
- **Next step**: Phase 19 — Email Verification

---

## 2026-03-31 — Phase 12a: Prospector (Contact Discovery via Prospeo.io)

- **Branch**: `claude/festive-dirac` → **PR #14**
- **What was built**: Full Prospector feature — `/prospector` page with filter panel (countries multiselect with Nordic countries at top, job title freetext comma-separated, industry pill toggles, company size pills) + results table (pagination, row checkboxes, bulk action bar), Reveal & Add to CRM modal (list assignment, skip duplicates option, progress feedback, partial success reporting)
- **API routes** (both server-side, key never exposed to client):
  - `POST /api/prospector/search` — proxies to Prospeo search-person; builds filters from UI state; handles all error codes (INSUFFICIENT_CREDITS → 402, RATE_LIMITED → 429, INVALID_FILTERS → 400, NO_RESULTS → empty response)
  - `POST /api/prospector/add-contacts` — sequential processing with 100ms delays; enriches via Prospeo enrich-person (1 credit/contact); upserts company by domain; inserts contact with `source='prospector'`; handles list create or assign; returns `{added, skipped, errors}`
- **Migration**: `supabase/migrations/20260331000000_add_contacts_source.sql` — adds `source TEXT` column to contacts; applied to prod via Supabase MCP
- **Types**: `database.types.ts` updated with `source` field on contacts Row/Insert/Update
- **Sidebar**: Prospector added between Lists and Templates with `Search` icon
- **Notable decisions**: title/city/country stored in `custom_fields` (contacts table has no dedicated columns); contacts without verified email get placeholder email `prospector_noemail_{person_id}@placeholder.invalid` to satisfy NOT NULL; company upsert uses domain lookup to avoid duplicates
- **Build status**: TypeScript compiled clean; pre-existing prerender build failures on `/settings/pipelines` and `/contacts/import` (missing Supabase env vars locally — unrelated to this PR)
- **What Jacob needs to do**: Add `PROSPEO_API_KEY` to `.env.local` and Vercel env vars after signing up at prospeo.io

---

## 2026-03-31 — Phase 10: Campaign Execution Infrastructure

- **What was built**: Full campaign launch flow — `LaunchCampaignModal` (2-step: pick list → preflight checklist + send rate estimate → enroll), `GET /api/sequences/[id]/preflight` (auth-verified: checks Gmail, email steps, missing data, already-enrolled), analytics page at `/sequences/[id]/analytics` (8 stat cards: enrolled/sent/open/reply/click rate, bounce rate, unsub rate, completed; per-step bar chart via existing `SequenceAnalyticsTab`; paginated enrollment table with status filter), "Launch Campaign" primary button + "View Analytics →" link on sequence detail page, bounce suppression check in `process-emails` cron (cancels queued emails for bounced/unsubscribed contacts)
- **Files changed**: 6 — `src/app/api/cron/process-emails/route.ts`, `src/components/sequences/launch-campaign-modal.tsx` (new), `src/app/api/sequences/[id]/preflight/route.ts` (new), `src/app/(dashboard)/sequences/[id]/analytics/page.tsx` (replaced placeholder), `src/app/(dashboard)/sequences/[id]/page.tsx`, `e2e/campaign-launch.spec.ts` (new, 3 tests)
- **Migration**: None — all 18 tables already existed
- **Test result**: TypeScript clean (`tsc --noEmit` zero errors); E2E suite not re-run from worktree (pre-existing env-var build issue in worktree environment); PR #13 open for review
- **Next step**: Jacob merges PR #13, then pull + proceed to next phase per roadmap

---

## 2026-03-29 — Health Check & Deep Clean

- **What was built**: Full hygiene pass — ESLint fixed to zero (created `eslint.config.mjs` since Next.js 16 removed `next lint`), TypeScript clean, 8 merged remote branches deleted, 2 npm audit vulnerabilities fixed, `zod` removed (unused), dead code deleted (PipelineChart, test-insert debug route, 3 unused lib exports)
- **Files changed**: 21 files — `eslint.config.mjs` (new), `package.json/lock`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.env.local.example`, `sequence-builder.tsx` (extracted inline component), `list-detail-client.tsx` (useMemo for filters), 8 hook dep fixes, 3 unused-export removals
- **Migration**: None
- **Test result**: 33/33 E2E tests passing against production (unchanged)
- **Next step**: Phase 10 (campaign execution infrastructure) — prompt is ready in `docs/prompts/`

---

## Earlier Sessions (before log was established)

Phases 1–9 complete. App live at https://crm-for-saas.vercel.app. Pre-10 bugs fixed (Gmail connect UX, enrollment flow). 33/33 E2E tests passing. Phase QA (Playwright suite) written and passing.

---

## 2026-03-31 — Phase 14: Inbox + Reply Management

- **Branch**: `feature/inbox-reply-management`
- **What was built**:
  - **DB migration** (`supabase/migrations/20260401000000_inbox_messages.sql`): Added `gmail_thread_id TEXT` to `email_queue`; created `inbox_messages` table (16 columns, RLS, trigger, indexes); applied to prod via Supabase MCP
  - **database.types.ts**: Added `gmail_thread_id` to email_queue Row/Insert/Update; added full `inbox_messages` table definition
  - **process-emails cron** (`src/app/api/cron/process-emails/route.ts`): After successful send, fetches the Gmail message to get `threadId` and stores it in `email_queue.gmail_thread_id` (non-fatal if this fails)
  - **check-replies cron** (full rewrite): Now polls Gmail threads for real replies — groups sent emails by (sender_account_id, gmail_thread_id), calls `threads.get` once per thread, skips messages from our own address, deduplicates via `inbox_messages.gmail_message_id UNIQUE`, inserts `inbox_messages` rows + `email_events` reply records, updates contact `last_contacted_at`, creates activity records; bounce detection logic preserved from previous implementation
  - **API routes** (5 routes):
    - `GET /api/inbox` — list messages with filter (all/unread/interested/not_interested/out_of_office), pagination, contact+queue joins
    - `PATCH /api/inbox/[id]` — update is_read and category; auto-qualifies contact when category→'interested'
    - `GET /api/inbox/[id]/thread` — returns unified outgoing+incoming thread sorted by timestamp
    - `POST /api/inbox/[id]/reply` — sends reply via Gmail API with In-Reply-To header, creates activity
    - `GET /api/inbox/unread-count` — returns `{ count }` for sidebar badge
  - **Inbox page** (`src/app/(dashboard)/inbox/`): Two-panel layout — left: filterable conversation list with unread dot, contact avatar, preview snippet, category badge, relative timestamp; right: thread view with outgoing/incoming messages styled differently, action bar (Interested/Not Interested/OOO/Read toggle), category dropdown, contact link, collapsible reply composer
  - **Sidebar**: Added Inbox nav item between Prospector and Templates with `Inbox` icon; polls `/api/inbox/unread-count` every 60s and shows red badge with count
  - **E2E tests** (`e2e/inbox.spec.ts`): 3 smoke tests — GET /api/inbox, GET /api/inbox/unread-count, PATCH with nonexistent ID
- **Build status**: TypeScript compiled clean; zero errors; all 32 routes generated
- **Notable decisions**: Reply detection uses thread polling (not push webhooks) since no Pub/Sub setup; stop_on_reply logic in check-replies now correctly triggers off real reply events; manual replies from inbox are not tracked (no pixel/link wrapping) since they're human-initiated; lint script is pre-existing broken (no eslint.config.mjs in repo)

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 12b: Prospector Bug Fix + Search UI Upgrade

- **Branch**: `claude/elegant-tereshkova`
- **PR**: #16
- **Files changed**: `src/app/(dashboard)/prospector/page.tsx`, `src/app/api/prospector/search/route.ts`
- **What was built**:
  - **Bug fix**: `company_headcount_range` values corrected to Prospeo's exact API enum — previous values ("11-50", "51-200", "1001-5000") didn't exist in their API, causing 400 on all size-filtered searches
  - **Size filter**: Now multi-select pill toggles (8 buckets: 1–10 through 5001+); was single-select radio buttons
  - **Seniority filter**: New multi-select pills using all 10 Prospeo-valid values; added `seniorities` field to `Filters` type and `SearchRequestBody`; sends `person_seniority` to Prospeo API
  - **Industry values**: Updated to Prospeo's exact enum strings (e.g. "Repair and Maintenance", "Motor Vehicle Manufacturing")
  - **Job title input**: Replaced textarea with tag-input — Enter or comma adds tag, × removes; suggested chips (Workshop owner, Verkstadschef, etc.) shown as dimmed clickable chips; `jobTitlesRaw: string` → `jobTitles: string[]`
  - **Minimum filter guard**: Toast error if none of country/title/industry/seniority are set before search
  - **Result count**: Changed "contacts found" → "matching profiles"
- **Build status**: TypeScript clean (tsc --noEmit passes); 1 pre-existing lint warning (no-html-link-for-pages in modal, untouched code)
- **Notable decisions**: Build itself fails on /settings/pipelines prerender (pre-existing Supabase env var issue in static build, not related to these changes)

## Phase 12c — Prospector Complete API Fix + UI Rebuild
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**PR:** #17
**Branch:** claude/epic-hodgkin

### What was built
- Rewrote `src/app/api/prospector/search/route.ts`: updated `SearchRequestBody` type to include `personCountries`, `keywords`, `verifiedEmailOnly`, `maxPerCompany`; fixed `person_location` → `person_location_search`; added `company_keywords`, `person_contact_details`, `max_person_per_company` filter blocks
- Rewrote `src/app/(dashboard)/prospector/page.tsx`: new `Filters` type with `personCountries` (was `countries`), `keywords`, `verifiedEmailOnly` (default true), `maxPerCompany` (default 1); filter panel reorganized with section headers (Who / Where / Company / Quality); added Company Keywords text input; added Verified emails only toggle; added Max per company number input
- Fixed industry values: `"Vehicle Repair and Maintenance"` (was `"Repair and Maintenance"`), added `"Automotive"`, `"Car Dealers"`, `"Parts & Wholesale"`, fixed `"Transportation Logistics Supply Chain and Storage"` (no commas)
- Updated search guard to also check `keywords.trim().length > 0`
- Replaced `<a>` nav with `<Link>` for `/contacts` and `/lists/:id` (lint fix)

### Build status
TypeScript: 0 errors. Lint: 0 warnings. Build: compiled successfully (pre-existing `/contacts/import` prerender error unrelated to this session).

## 2026-04-01 — Phase 12d: Prospector Bilingual Job Title Search

- **Branch**: `claude/great-taussig` → **PR #18**
- **What was built**:
  - Replaced mixed-language `SUGGESTED_JOB_TITLES` with clean English-only list (8 automotive titles)
  - Added `COUNTRY_LANGUAGE` map (11 countries) and `JOB_TITLE_TRANSLATIONS` table (8 titles × 6 languages)
  - Added helper functions: `getActiveLanguages`, `getTranslations`, `buildSearchTitles`
  - Job title chips now display translation labels beneath them when countries with known languages are selected
  - New "Search in X only" checkbox — conditionally shown when relevant; unchecked = English + local; checked = local only (with English fallback for untranslatable titles)
  - `buildSearchPayload` now expands job titles via `buildSearchTitles` before sending to Prospeo
  - Added `localOnly: boolean` to `Filters` type and `DEFAULT_FILTERS`
- **Only file changed**: `src/app/(dashboard)/prospector/page.tsx`
- **Build**: TypeScript clean (`npx tsc --noEmit` passes). Lint clean. Build error is pre-existing worktree env issue (Supabase vars not set), not related to this change.

## Phase 12e — AI Prospector Filter

- **Date**: 2026-04-01
- **Branch**: `claude/relaxed-chatelet` → PR TBD
- **What was built**:
  - Installed `@anthropic-ai/sdk`
  - Created `supabase/migrations/20260401120000_workspace_ai_settings.sql` — new `workspace_ai_settings` table with RLS policies using `get_user_workspace_ids()` pattern; applied via Supabase MCP
  - `src/app/api/settings/ai-filter/route.ts` — GET/POST to fetch and upsert ICP prompt + filter_enabled flag per workspace
  - `src/app/api/prospector/ai-filter/route.ts` — POST endpoint that calls `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001` to evaluate prospect profiles against the workspace ICP; returns good/maybe/poor verdicts with reasons; graceful fallback on AI failure
  - `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/ai-filter/page.tsx` — ICP editor with toggle, 12-row textarea pre-filled with Wrenchlane ICP, Save button, and inline test tool
  - Updated `src/app/(dashboard)/settings/page.tsx` — added AI Lead Filter card with Sparkles icon
  - Updated `src/app/(dashboard)/prospector/page.tsx`:
    - Added `FitVerdict` type and `FitBadge` component (good/maybe/poor with tooltip)
    - New state: `verdicts`, `aiCheckLoading`, `fitFilter`, `aiFilterEnabled`, `smartReveal`
    - `useEffect` on mount fetches AI filter enabled status from settings API and loads `smartReveal` from localStorage
    - `handleAiCheck` — sends selected profiles to AI filter API, stores verdicts, auto-deselects poor fits
    - AI Check button in action bar (only when filter enabled)
    - Smart Reveal toggle in action bar (only after first check)
    - `handleBulkAdd` skips poor fits when Smart Reveal is on
    - Fit filter bar (All / Good / Maybe / Poor tabs) above table when verdicts exist
    - Fit column in results table; poor-fit rows dimmed at 50% opacity
    - `displayedResults` derived from `fitFilter` state
- **Build**: TypeScript ✓, lint ✓, tsc --noEmit ✓ (prerender error in worktree is env-var issue, not code)
- **Note**: Supabase types don't include new table yet — used `(supabase as any)` cast in API routes; types will resolve after `supabase gen types` is run post-deploy

---

## Phase 15 — Sequence Reliability & Stop Logic
**Date:** 2026-04-01 | **PR:** #20 | **Branch:** feature/phase15-sequence-reliability

- **OOO detection**: Added `isAutoReply()` to check-replies cron; checks RFC headers (auto-submitted, x-autoreply, x-auto-response-suppress, precedence) and multilingual OOO subject patterns (EN/SV/NO/DA/DE/FI). OOO messages stored with `is_auto_reply=true`, `category='out_of_office'`, still create email_event + activity but do NOT trigger unenrollment. Tracks `realRepliesFound` vs `autoRepliesFound` separately.
- **Company-level stop**: After real reply triggers stop_on_reply, finds all other active enrollments where contact has same `company_id`, sets them to `company_paused`, cancels scheduled queue items, creates activity records per paused contact. Controlled by new `stop_on_company_reply` setting (default true) in SequenceSettings.
- **Per-enrollment Pause/Resume + Pause All**: New `PATCH /api/sequences/enrollments/[id]` (pause/resume) and `POST /api/sequences/[id]/pause-all`; analytics page has per-row action buttons; sequence detail page has "Pause All" button with confirmation modal. `company_paused` status badge added.
- **Email threading**: process-emails looks up most recent sent email in enrollment, passes `gmail_message_id` as `replyToMessageId` (In-Reply-To/References headers) and `gmail_thread_id` as `replyToThreadId` to Gmail API; prepends "Re: " to subject for follow-up steps. Also fixed dead code in `send.ts` (threadId was `? undefined : undefined`).
- **Health badges**: `GET /api/sequences/health` returns auth_issue/high_bounces/paused_count per sequence; sequence-list loads these once and renders inline color-coded badges.
- **Migration applied**: `inbox_messages.is_auto_reply boolean DEFAULT false` — applied to Supabase project wdgiwuhehqpkhpvdzzzl.
- **Build**: TypeScript ✓, lint ✓, tsc --noEmit ✓. 13 files changed, 3 new API routes, 1 migration file.

## Phase 16 — Smart Throttling & Circuit Breaker
**Date:** 2026-04-01 | **Branch:** feature/phase16-smart-throttling | **PR:** #21

### What was built

- **Send jitter** (`process-emails/route.ts`): Cron now sends at most 1 email per sender per run. After the first send, remaining items in the sender's batch are rescheduled with random 30–120s delays (×position index). This avoids robotic back-to-back sending without risking Vercel function timeouts from `sleep()`.
- **Circuit breaker** (`process-emails/route.ts`): Before each sender loop, checks 24h bounce rate. If `recentSends >= 20` AND `bounceRate > threshold`: auto-pause the gmail_account (status='paused', pause_reason=message), cancel all scheduled queue items for sender, insert system activity record. Threshold read from `workspaces.sending_settings.bounce_threshold` (default 8%).
- **New API: PATCH /api/settings/email/[accountId]**: Updates account `max_daily_sends`, `status`, `pause_reason`. Resuming (status→active) auto-clears `pause_reason`. Auth-checks workspace membership.
- **New API: GET/PATCH /api/settings/sending**: Reads/writes `workspaces.sending_settings` JSONB. Returns defaults (`default_max_daily_sends: 50`, `bounce_threshold: 8`) merged with stored values.
- **GmailAccountCard** updated: Shows `paused` (red) badge, displays `pause_reason` text in alert box, Resume button (green, Play icon) calls PATCH → status active. Disconnect now calls PATCH API instead of direct Supabase client write.
- **EmailSettingsClient** updated: Loads workspace sending settings via new API. Adds "Workspace Defaults" card with today's total sends (read-only), editable `default_max_daily_sends` and `bounce_threshold %` inputs, Save button.
- **Migration** (`20260401130000_phase16_smart_throttling.sql`): `gmail_accounts.pause_reason TEXT`, `workspaces.sending_settings JSONB DEFAULT '{}'` — applied to wdgiwuhehqpkhpvdzzzl.
- **database.types.ts**: `pause_reason` on gmail_accounts Row/Insert/Update; `sending_settings` on workspaces Row/Insert/Update; new `WorkspaceSendingSettings` type exported.

### Build status
TypeScript ✓, lint ✓ (0 warnings), tsc --noEmit ✓. 7 files changed (3 new), 1 migration applied.

### Notable decisions
- One-email-per-sender-per-run approach chosen over `sleep()` to stay within Vercel function time limits
- Circuit breaker requires ≥20 sends before triggering (prevents single-bounce false positives on new accounts)
- Bounce rate uses a two-step query (get queue IDs for sender, then count bounces) — no RPC needed

---

## Phase 17 — Compliance & DNC
**Date:** 2026-04-01
**Branch:** feature/phase17-compliance-dnc
**PR:** (see below)

### What was built
- **`suppressions` table** — unified suppression list (email + domain blocking, reason tracking, soft deletes). Applied via Supabase MCP. Migrated existing `unsubscribes` rows into it on creation.
- **database.types.ts** — added `suppressions` table TypeScript types.
- **Unsubscribe route** — now inserts into `suppressions` alongside existing `unsubscribes` upsert (backward compat kept).
- **check-replies route** — bounce detection now also inserts into `suppressions` after updating contact status.
- **process-emails route** — replaced `unsubscribes` table check with `suppressions` check; now covers both email-level AND domain-level blocks.
- **preflight route** — added `suppressedCount` to the response (counts email + domain suppressions for the list).
- **launch-campaign-modal** — shows orange warning "X contacts suppressed (unsubscribed, bounced, or DNC) — will be skipped" in preflight.
- **prospector add-contacts** — checks `suppressions` before inserting each contact; returns `suppressed` count in response.
- **`POST /api/contacts/[id]/forget`** — GDPR erasure endpoint: adds email to suppressions, cancels pending emails, deletes all related records, deletes contact, logs anonymized activity.
- **Contact detail UI** — "Delete & Forget (GDPR)" button with confirmation modal.
- **Settings → Compliance & DNC page** — stats bar (total/breakdown by reason), paginated suppression table with reason badges, Add Email / Add Domain dialogs, CSV bulk import (papaparse), Remove (soft delete) per row.
- **Compliance API routes** — `GET/POST /api/settings/compliance`, `PATCH /api/settings/compliance/[id]`, `POST /api/settings/compliance/import`.
- **Incidental fix** — added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to `/contacts/import` page (was failing to prerender due to missing Supabase client init at build time).

### Build status
- `npm run build` ✅
- `npm run lint` ✅ (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- `npx tsc --noEmit` ✅

### Notable decisions
- `created_by` column on `suppressions` stored as plain UUID (no FK) — `workspace_members.user_id` has no unique constraint.
- Actual `unsubscribes` schema uses `unsubscribed_at` (not `created_at`) — migration adjusted accordingly.
- Suppression check in `process-emails` uses `.or()` with both email and domain to cover domain blocks in one query.
- Preflight suppression count may slightly overcount if both email+domain match same contact — acceptable as it's a warning.
- `unsubscribes` table kept untouched for backward compatibility.
